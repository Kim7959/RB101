=begin A method that returns the sum of two integers
Given there are 2 integers input from user
Add the two integers
save the sum of the two integers to a local variable
return the result

=end 

=begin
START
SET integer_1 as user input
    integer_2 as user input
    sum = integer_1 + integer_2
GET user input of two integers
PRINT sum

END
=end

=begin A method that takes an array of str and returns a string
that is all those strings concat together
Given an array of multiple strings
Iterate through array
Take each string and add them together to form one long string
return this new string value
=end

=begin
START
Given an array of strings
SET counter = 0
    concat result variable
WHILE iterator <= array size
  result = result variable + current iteration
PRINT result
END
=end

=begin a method that takes array of int and returns new array
with every other element from original array, start with first
elementl

Given an array of integers
Iterate over the array
return first element then every other element to new array
print the result
=end

=begin
START
Given an array of integers
SET counter = 0
WHILE counter < array size
  iterate over array elements
  add to first element, skip every other element
print the restult
END
